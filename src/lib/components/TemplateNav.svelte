	## Fiction Machine A layout that I largely use for publishing my fiction online. I think it makes
	for good reading. ## Magazine A magazine-style layout with large sans-serif and slab fonts loosely
	based on the style of [Teehan + Lax](https://teehanlax.com/) ## Scriptdown This template will
	actually convert markdown into a screenplay style format.
